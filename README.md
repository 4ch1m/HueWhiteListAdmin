# HueWhiteListAdmin
A simple tool for the hue lighting system from Philips

##About
This Android app can help you to keep the bridge configuration of your personal hue lighting system clean.

* Have you been trying out several hue-apps from the store?
* Did you remove most of these apps from your device afterwards and don't plan to use them again?
* Or maybe you completely reinstalled your phone/tablet and just had to authorize all of your favourite hue-apps again?

Well... then it might be a good idea to review the configuration of your hue-bridge and see if there are obsolete entries left.

With HueWhiteListAdmin you can easily remove any unused authorization-keys from your bridge or just check which apps actually had access to your system recently.
